# **LEVERAGING INTERPRETABLE MACHINE LEARNING FOR DROUGHT MONITORING IN THE CANARY ISLANDS

A Python-based framework for computing SPEI, engineering predictive features, training machine learning models, and generating interpretable drought forecasts across the Canary Islands. The workflow integrates Random Forest and XGBoost models with SHAP and LIME interpretability tools, producing transparent, data-driven predictions of short-term drought conditions. 

## Project Overview

This repository implements the modelling pipeline used in the study “Leveraging Interpretable Machine Learning for Drought Monitoring in the Canary Islands: A Data‑Driven Study.”
